### Hallo! I study the universe :D

I am a PhD student studying astronomy at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. My research experience equips for myself my technical skills in analyzing astronomical images and time series data, visulaizing the analysis and interpreting the findings. My current focus is to apply moving average processes in modeling the multi-wavelegnth light curves for the black hole in the Galactic Center.

While my primary focus is on astronomy, I am also driven by a curiosity to solve problems from daily life using machine learning. I participated in a machine learning project in classifying 20 most common house plants with deep learning. Additionally, I enojy learning new things and my recent interets is to know how to build a scalable ML pipeline on the cloud.

<br /> Chung (鍾) is my last name. Hui-Hsuan (慧萱) is my first name. Hui means wisdom and Hsuan means fulvous daylily.
