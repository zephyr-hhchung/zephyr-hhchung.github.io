### Hello, I am Hui-Hsuan (Zephyr) Chung!

I am currently a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany since January 2021. I study the multi-wavelength light curves of Sgr A\* where I focus on deriving the statistical properties of the temporal variability, which is useful in constraining the radiative models of Sgr A\*.

I began my astronomy journey at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, where I analyzed the SED of nearby galaxies from the megamaser survey to extract AGN emissions using optical and infrared photometry. 

After that, I study my Master's degree in astronomy at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. I applied a Bayesian technique to analyze the X-ray spectra of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with Chandra data for my thesis.

### About my name
Hui-Hsuan Chung is a romanized name from three Chinese characters: 鍾 慧萱. 
<br /> Chung (鍾) is my last name. Hui-Hsuan (慧萱) is my first name. Hui means wisdom and Hsuan means fulvous daylily.
