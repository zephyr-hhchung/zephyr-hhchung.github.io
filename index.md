### Hallo! I study the universe :D

I am an [astronomy](/astro/) PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. I play with (or analyze, model and sometime siumate) data taken from the telescopes. The data can be galaxy images, spectra of compact objects, or time series data captured from black holes. 

As an astronomer, I have the chance to visit and observe at different telescope sites and travel around the world to attend conference to share my studyings. Besides, I am a big fan of new technologies and I am currently applying [machine learning](/projects/) to solve daily life problems as an effective way to learning it! During my leisure time, I enjoy many [hobbies](/activity/) such as running, hackathons, and learning German!

<br /> Chung (鍾) is my last name. Hui-Hsuan (慧萱) is my first name. Hui means wisdom and Hsuan means fulvous daylily.
