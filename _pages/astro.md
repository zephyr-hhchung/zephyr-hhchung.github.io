### Here you can find some astronomy projects I've done

I currently study for my doctoral degree at the Max planck Institute for Radio Astronomy with a focus on the multi-wavelength light curves of Sgr A\* since January 2021. I analyze the statistical properties of the temporal variability, which is useful in constraining the radiative models of Sgr A\*.

I began my astronomy journey at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, where I analyzed the spectral energy distribution of nearby galaxies using their optical and infrared photometry to extract the infrared emissions resulted from black hole. 

After that, I study my Master's degree in astronomy at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. I applied a Bayesian technique to analyze the X-ray spectra of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with Chandra X-ray data for my thesis.
