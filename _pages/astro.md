### Here you can find some astronomy projects I've done

I currently study for my doctoral degree at the Max planck Institute for Radio Astronomy with a focus on the multi-wavelength light curves of Sgr A\* since January 2021. I analyze the statistical properties of the temporal variability, which is useful in constraining the radiative models of Sgr A\*.

<!-- My research experience equips for myself my technical skills in analyzing astronomical images and time series data, visulaizing the analysis and interpreting the findings. My current focus is to apply moving average processes in modeling the multi-wavelegnth light curves for the black hole in the Galactic Center. -->


I began my astronomy journey at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, where I analyzed the spectral energy distribution of nearby galaxies using their optical and infrared photometry to extract the infrared emissions resulted from black hole. 

After that, I study my Master's degree in astronomy at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. I applied a Bayesian technique to analyze the X-ray spectra of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with Chandra X-ray data for my thesis.
