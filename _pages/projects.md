While my primary focus is on astronomy, I am also driven by a curiosity to solve problems from daily life using machine learning. I participated in a machine learning project in classifying 20 most common house plants with deep learning. Additionally, I enojy learning new things and my recent interets is to know how to build a scalable ML pipeline on the cloud.
